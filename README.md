## Description
Conducted an analysis on an airline passenger satisfaction dataset to pinpoint the primary factors behind a recent decline in customer satisfaction. Developed a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to present findings and proposed a data-driven strategy aimed at boosting overall satisfaction. The insights from this project enabled the airline to implement essential changes, leading to improved customer satisfaction and a better travel experience for passengers

## Project Overview

The airline industry is fiercely competitive, and customer satisfaction is a crucial determinant of an airline's success. Recently, the leadership team of an airline noticed a decline in passenger satisfaction ratings and sought data-driven recommendations to enhance overall satisfaction.
This project aimed to analyze an extensive dataset of airline passenger satisfaction scores to identify the key factors contributing to the decline and provide actionable strategies to improve satisfaction levels. The dataset included feedback from over 120,100 passengers, covering various aspects of their experience such as cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall satisfaction, along with details about each passenger's flight and type of travel. The analysis involved calculating several key performance indicators, including the total number of passengers, average arrival and departure delays, and satisfaction and dissatisfaction rates. This comprehensive analysis aimed to uncover the primary reasons behind the recent drop in satisfaction rates.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
KPIs are measurable values that organizations use to track and evaluate their progress towards achieving specific business objectives. They are used to measure performance over time and allow organizations to make data-driven decisions based on actual results. KPIs are specific to the objectives of an organization or department and can be qualitative or quantitative. They are important metrics that help organizations identify areas for improvement, set targets for future performance, and track their success in meeting their goals.

```Satisfaction Rate = (Total Satisfied Customers / Total Passengers) x 100%```

Dissatisfaction Rate: The percentage of passengers who reported being neutral or dissatisfied with their flight experience, calculated as the ratio of Total Dissatisfied Customers to Total Passengers.

```Dissatisfaction Rate = (Total Dissatisfied Customers / Total Passengers) x 100%```
